# Income Tax Brackets for 2024 Released by IRS - The Wall Street Journal

## Professional English
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has released the income tax brackets for the year 2024. These brackets determine the percentage of income that individuals and families will owe in federal taxes. The new brackets reflect adjustments for inflation and are used to calculate tax liability based on income levels. The IRS updates the tax brackets annually to account for changes in the cost of living. The brackets for 2024 show slight increases in the income thresholds for each tax bracket, which means that individuals and families will be able to earn slightly more income before moving into a higher tax bracket. This adjustment aims to prevent taxpayers from being pushed into higher tax brackets solely due to inflation. The IRS also announced changes to the standard deduction and personal exemption amounts for 2024. The standard deduction is a fixed amount that reduces the amount of income subject to tax, while the personal exemption allows taxpayers to deduct a specific amount for themselves and their dependents. These changes will impact the amount of taxable income and ultimately the tax liability for individuals and families. Taxpayers should review the new tax brackets and other changes to ensure they are accurately calculating their tax liability for the upcoming year.
