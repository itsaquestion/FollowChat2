The market is eagerly awaiting the U.S. Labor Department's report on nonfarm payrolls, which is expected to provide insights into the state of the job market and the potential impact on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. This data is crucial as it could influence the central bank's decision on whether to taper its bond-buying program and raise interest rates sooner than anticipated.
