Gaza Officials Say Hospitals Come Under New Israeli Attacks Gaza
hospitals have reportedly come under new attacks by Israeli forces,
according to officials in the region. The attacks have raised concerns
about the already strained healthcare system in Gaza, which has been
grappling with a surge in COVID-19 cases. The officials have accused
Israel of deliberately targeting medical facilities, including a
hospital that was hit by an airstrike. The Israeli military has stated
that it only targets sites used by Hamas, the militant group that
controls Gaza. However, the United Nations has called for an immediate
halt to the attacks on hospitals and other civilian infrastructure. The
escalating violence in the region has resulted in a growing number of
casualties, including many civilians. The international community has
expressed deep concern over the situation and has called for a peaceful
