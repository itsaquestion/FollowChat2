\chapter{Professional English}\label{professional-english}}

Brazil's defense minister, Walter Braga Netto, expressed anger over a
statement made by Israel regarding a foiled Hezbollah attack. The
Israeli ambassador to Brazil, Giora Becher, claimed that the Brazilian
government had been informed about the planned attack, but failed to
take action. Netto strongly denied these allegations, stating that
Brazil had not received any such information from Israel. He further
criticized Israel for making public statements without verifying the
facts. The Brazilian government has requested an explanation from Israel
and expects a formal apology. The incident has strained the diplomatic
relations between the two countries. Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant
group, has been designated as a terrorist organization by several
countries, including the United States and Israel. Brazil has been
cooperating with international partners to combat terrorism and maintain
national security.
