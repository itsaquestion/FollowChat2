Brazil's defense minister, Walter Braga Netto, expressed anger over a
statement made by Israel regarding a foiled Hezbollah attack. The
Israeli ambassador to Brazil, Giora Becher, claimed that the Brazilian
government had been informed about the planned attack, but failed to
act. Netto strongly denied these allegations, stating that Brazil had
not received any prior information from Israel. He further criticized
the Israeli government for making such statements without providing
evidence. The tension between Brazil and Israel has escalated, with
Netto summoning the Israeli ambassador for an explanation. The Brazilian
government has demanded a public apology from Israel for the false
accusations. The incident has strained the diplomatic relations between
the two countries, as Brazil considers Hezbollah a terrorist
organization and has been actively working to combat its activities
within its borders. The Brazilian government has also expressed concerns
about the potential impact of these false accusations on its
international reputation. The Israeli government has not yet responded
to the Brazilian demands for an apology.

Celsius Network, a cryptocurrency lending platform, has been given
approval to exit bankruptcy, according to a report by Reuters. The
company had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 2023
after facing financial difficulties. However, a U.S. bankruptcy judge
has now cleared Celsius Network to emerge from bankruptcy and continue
its operations. The judge's decision was based on the company's
successful restructuring plan, which involved reducing its debt and
securing new funding. Celsius Network, founded in 2017, offers
interest-earning accounts and loans backed by cryptocurrencies. The
company has gained popularity in the crypto industry, attracting over 1
million users and managing more than \$20 billion in assets. With its
exit from bankruptcy, Celsius Network aims to regain stability and
further expand its services in the growing cryptocurrency market.

company had asked for protection from bankruptcy in August 2023 because
it was having money problems. But now, a judge in the United States has
said that Celsius Network can stop being bankrupt and keep working. The

problems. The plan included getting less debt and finding new money.
Celsius Network started in 2017 and it lets people earn interest on
their cryptocurrency and borrow money using it as security. Many people
like Celsius Network and more than 1 million people use it. The company
also manages more than \$20 billion in cryptocurrency. Celsius Network

According to a recent article by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ),
third-party candidates could potentially pose a threat to President Joe
Biden's re-election bid in 2024. The article highlights the historical
impact of third-party candidates on past elections and suggests that
their presence in the upcoming election could divide the Democratic
vote. The WSJ points out that third-party candidates often attract
voters who are dissatisfied with the two major parties, and their
participation could potentially siphon off votes that would have
otherwise gone to Biden. The article also discusses the potential
influence of prominent figures like former President Donald Trump, who
might choose to run as a third-party candidate. While it remains
uncertain whether third-party candidates will have a significant impact
on the 2024 election, the WSJ suggests that their presence could
complicate Biden's path to re-election.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has released the income tax brackets
for the year 2024. These brackets determine the percentage of income
that individuals and families will owe in federal taxes. The new
brackets reflect adjustments for inflation and are used to calculate tax
liability based on income levels. The IRS updates the tax brackets
annually to account for changes in the cost of living. The brackets for
2024 show slight increases in the income thresholds for each tax
bracket, which means that individuals and families will be able to earn
slightly more income before moving into a higher tax bracket. This
adjustment aims to prevent taxpayers from being pushed into higher tax
brackets solely due to inflation. The IRS also announced changes to the
standard deduction and personal exemption amounts for 2024. The standard
deduction is a fixed amount that reduces the amount of income subject to
tax, while the personal exemption allows taxpayers to deduct a specific
amount for themselves and their dependents. These changes will impact
the amount of taxable income and ultimately the tax liability for
individuals and families. Taxpayers should review the new tax brackets
and other changes to ensure they are accurately calculating their tax
liability for the upcoming year.

The IRS has released the income tax brackets for 2024. These brackets
determine how much money people and families have to pay in taxes to the
government. The new brackets are based on how much money people make.
The IRS updates the brackets every year to keep up with the cost of
living. The brackets for 2024 show that people can earn a little more
money before they have to pay a higher percentage of taxes. This is to
make sure that people don't have to pay more taxes just because the cost
of living goes up. The IRS also made changes to the standard deduction
and personal exemption amounts for 2024. The standard deduction is a set
amount of money that reduces the amount of income that gets taxed. The
personal exemption lets people deduct a certain amount of money for
themselves and their dependents. These changes will affect how much
money people have to pay in taxes. People should look at the new tax
brackets and other changes to make sure they are calculating their taxes
correctly for next year.

also made changes to the standard deduction and personal exemption
amounts for 2024. The standard deduction is a fixed amount that reduces
the income subject to tax. And the personal exemption allows you to
deduct a specific amount for yourself and your dependents. These changes
will affect how much money you have to pay in taxes. So, it's important
to review the new tax brackets and other changes to make sure you're
accurately calculating your tax liability for the upcoming year.
