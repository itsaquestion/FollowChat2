The United States has announced its plan to tackle climate
super-pollutants in the oil and gas industry ahead of the 28th UN
Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP 28). The plan aims to
reduce emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and other
super-pollutants by implementing stricter regulations and promoting the
use of cleaner technologies. The US government plans to work closely
with industry stakeholders to achieve these goals by 2023. This
initiative is part of the country's broader efforts to combat climate
change and transition to a more sustainable energy future.

Methane, which is released during the extraction, production, and
transportation of oil and gas, is estimated to be over 80 times more
potent than carbon dioxide in terms of its warming potential over a
20-year period. By targeting methane emissions, the US aims to
significantly reduce its contribution to global warming. The plan
includes measures such as strengthening leak detection and repair
requirements, improving data collection and reporting, and incentivizing
the adoption of methane reduction technologies. These actions are
expected to not only mitigate climate change but also improve air
quality and public health.
