Aria: Hey everyone, welcome to today's episode of "The English Corner." Today, we're talking about Netflix and their recent news. So, Netflix just announced that they're raising their prices for some of their streaming plans in the US, UK, and France. But get this, despite all the strikes happening in Hollywood, Netflix gained almost 9 million new subscribers in the third quarter. That's crazy, right? And most of these new subscribers are from other countries. Netflix is really killing it with their investment in global stories, like "One Piece." And people are also binge-watching older shows on Netflix, like "Suits" and "Band of Brothers." The co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, said they have a huge selection of shows to choose from, so they can handle any problems caused by the pandemic. Oh, and did I mention that Hollywood actors are on strike? Yeah, but Netflix is determined to fix that. And investors are loving it, with the company's shares going up 13%. Oh, and one more thing, Netflix is also starting to show ads. But with 247 million subscribers, they're still the top streaming service. So, what do you think about all this? Let me know in the comments below. Thanks for tuning in to "The English Corner," see you next time!
